        <p>I have been doing research and create my first IT blog since 2012 then starting to design websites and I am passionate about the web development career. I am currently employed at the Waterfront Campus, George Brown College, Toronto Canada, as a web and application developer.</p>
        <p>I am a full stack developer. I take projects from the initial concept stage through to completion. I stay on top of leading front and back end technologies such as <strong>Word Press CMS, LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP), HTML 5 and CSS 3, Javascript and JQuery</strong> to ensure the optimum code peformance and site security for my clients.</p>
        <p>My favourite work environments are <strong>Laravel PHP Framework, VueJS and Angular 2</strong>. They are outstanding digital technologies because of pre-build flexibility, ease-of-use structure code that allows you to spend more time on creating an actual website instead of spending time on repetitive code.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I love to travel as much as possible. You can read at my travel blog.</p>
