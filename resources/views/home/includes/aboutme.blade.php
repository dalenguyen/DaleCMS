        <p>I have been doing research and create my first IT blog since 2012 then starting to design websites and I am passionate about the web development career. At the moment, I am working at <a href="http://gbcresearch.ca/about/our-team/" target="_blank">George Brown College</a> as a Web Developer.</p>
        <p>I am a full stack developer meaning I can take projects from initial concept stages all the way through to completion. I am comfortable working with front and back end technologies including <strong>WordPress CMS, LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP), HTML5 & CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery</strong> to ensure the products I create look and function well.</p>
        <p>My favourite framework: <strong>Laravel PHP Framework, VueJS and Angular 2</strong></p>
        <p>In my spare time, I love to travel as much as possible. You can read at my travel blog.</p>
